# 🚦 AI Traffic Lights

**English** | [Português (Brasil)](README.pt-BR.md)

[![CI](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A translucent always-on-top overlay (Electron) that shows the state of every
**terminal AI agent session** on your desktop as a traffic light: 🟢 done ·
🟡 working · 🔴 needs you.

Monitors **Claude Code**, **Antigravity**, **Codex** and **OpenCode** today. The
architecture is agent-agnostic — new agents land via adapters (see
[Adding an agent](#adding-a-new-agent)).

## Why

When you run several AI agent sessions in parallel across terminals, tabs and
projects, you lose track of which one finished, which is still crunching, and
which has been silently waiting for your approval for ten minutes. This
overlay gives you one glance: a light per session, click to jump to its
terminal — **window _and_ tab**.

## Features

- 🟢🟡🔴 One light per session, plus an aggregate light in the header
- 🤖 **Four agents, one overlay**: Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex and OpenCode
- 🌐 UI in English & Portuguese — follows the system locale, switchable in
  Preferences
- **Click-to-focus**: jumps to the session's terminal — the exact window, and
  in Warp the exact **tab** (via `warp://session/<uuid>`) and in Tilix the
  exact terminal (via D-Bus `TILIX_ID`)
- 🔔 Beep + desktop notification when a session turns red (rate-limited)
- ⏰ Idle escalation: a finished session left unattended turns red (configurable)
- 🔔 Per-session **alert snooze** (mute the beep for 1h on a red session)
- 🔝 Sessions **sort by urgency** (red → yellow → green); **dynamic tray icon**
  paints with the worst color and shows counts on hover
- 🚀 **Quick Launcher**: start an agent (+ Claude / + Antigravity / + Codex / +
  OpenCode) from the overlay empty-state or the tray — opens the terminal in
  the last project and the session lights up automatically
- ✏️ Double-click to rename a session (aliases persist per project)
- 👁 **Mark a red terminal as read**: clicking a 🔴 session focuses it *and*
  greys it out until a new notification arrives (toggle in Preferences)
- 📊 **Per-agent usage meters** (footer): one aligned row per usage window with
  a % meter and next reset — **Claude** (5-hour + weekly, real numbers from the
  OAuth usage API), **Codex** (5-hour + weekly, read passively from the session
  rollout) and **GLM Coding Plan** (5h tokens + monthly MCP). Rows go amber
  ≥70%, red ≥90%; the last value sticks (greys out when stale) and survives
  restarts. Toggle between the meters and the Quick Launcher in the header
- 🎚️ **Appearance**: window transparency slider + compact list mode
  (single dense row per session), both live and remembered
- ⚙️ **Preferences window** (gear icon): idle threshold, global shortcut,
  autostart, install/remove hooks, appearance, show/hide, quit — with the app
  version and a link to the repo in the footer
- Auto-height, drag anywhere, width-resizable, position + UI state persisted
- 🔄 **Version + update check** in the header — shows the installed version and,
  when a newer GitHub release exists, a one-click badge to open it
- Tray icon + global shortcut **`Ctrl+Alt+H`** (configurable)
- Stays out of your way: no taskbar/alt-tab entry, never maximizes, no scrollbar

## Requirements

- **Linux** (X11: full support, Wayland: partial — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) or **macOS** (supports Apple Silicon M1–M5).
- On Linux: `wmctrl`, `xdotool`, `jq` — `sudo apt install wmctrl xdotool jq`
- On macOS: Homebrew and `jq` — `brew install jq`
- Node.js 20+
- A supported agent: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code),
  [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/reference),
  [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)

## Install

Pick whichever fits your platform. **All options require the agent hooks** so the overlay can see Claude Code / Antigravity / OpenCode sessions — from source you run `npm run setup-hook`; in a packaged build you click **Install/update hooks** in the tray menu or Preferences window (or the overlay's onboarding button).

### macOS (M1 to M5 / arm64)

#### Option 1: Automated script (recommended)
Run the following single-line command in your terminal. It will verify dependencies (installing `jq` via Homebrew if needed), download the latest `.dmg` release, copy `AI Traffic Lights.app` to `/Applications`, and configure shell aliases (`atl` and `ai-traffic-lights`) in your `~/.zshrc` and `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/main/install_macos.sh | bash
```

To run the application from the terminal, open a new shell session (or run `source ~/.zshrc`) and execute:
```bash
atl
```

#### Option 2: Manual Install
1. Download the `.dmg` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/releases/latest).
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag `AI Traffic Lights.app` to your `/Applications` folder.

---

### Linux

#### Option 1: AppImage (recommended, self-updating)
A single command that fetches the latest release, makes it executable, installs the icon into the system theme, and creates an application menu shortcut:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open it from your application menu or run `~/Applications/AI-Traffic-Lights.AppImage`. To uninstall:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

<details><summary>Manual AppImage install</summary>

Grab the `.AppImage` from the [latest release](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/releases/latest), drop it in a user-writable folder (the self-updater rewrites that file in place — do not use `/opt` or `/usr`), and run:
```bash
chmod +x AI-Traffic-Lights-*.AppImage
./AI-Traffic-Lights-*.AppImage
```
</details>

#### Option 2: Debian Package (.deb)
Download the `.deb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/releases/latest) and install it:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ai-traffic-lights_*.deb
```

---

### From Source (Development - Linux & macOS)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights.git
cd ai-traffic-lights
npm install
npm run setup-hook   # registers the adapters: Claude Code (~/.claude),
                     # Antigravity CLI (~/.gemini/antigravity-cli) and OpenCode (plugin in
                     # ~/.config/opencode/plugin/), whichever are present
npm start            # opens the overlay
```

`setup-hook` is idempotent and surgical: it backs up `settings.json` and never touches hooks from other tools. The registered command points to a self-updating **stable copy** of the hook in `~/.local/share/ai-traffic-lights/bin/` — so moving the project (or running the packaged AppImage/App, whose mount path changes every run) never breaks it. `npm run remove-hook` undoes everything just as cleanly. The tray menu and Preferences window offer the same install/remove actions for packaged installs.

New Claude Code sessions show up immediately; sessions already open appear on their next event.

## How it works

```
Claude Code session ──hooks──▶ traffic-hook.sh (adapter, <25ms, fork-free)
                                      │ writes
                                      ▼
                    ~/.local/share/ai-traffic-lights/state/<session>.json
                                      │ watched (chokidar)
                                      ▼
                    Electron main ──IPC──▶ renderer: computeState() → 🟢🟡🔴
```

> **Architecture decision:** the adapter only records events. The **state
> (color) is computed in the renderer**, because idle escalation
> (green→red after N minutes) needs a clock — something an event-driven hook
> doesn't have.

> **The integration contract is the state file, not the code.** Anything that
> writes a valid JSON into the state dir becomes a light in the overlay.

> See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for integration diagrams and
> a step-by-step guide to adding an agent.

### State file contract (schema_version 2)

**Location:** `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ai-traffic-lights/state/<session_id>.json`

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 2,           // bump when the schema changes
  "agent": "claude",             // agent id (key in src/agents.js)
  "session_id": "abc-123",       // key, = file name
  "pid": 986893,                 // agent process PID (dead-session sweep)
  "cwd": "/home/user/project",   // project dir (basename = default label)
  "term_program": "WarpTerminal",// source terminal (null if unknown)
  "windowid": "67108868",        // X11 window of the session — see below
  "focus_url": "warp://session/8726…", // Warp: focus URI (xdg-open)
  "tilix_id": null,              // Tilix: terminal id for activate-terminal (D-Bus)
  "zellij_session": null,        // zellij session name, when inside zellij
  "last_event": "Stop",          // last hook_event_name
  "last_event_ts": 1783124001,   // epoch of the last event (UTC)
  "last_tool": "Bash",           // last tool_name (null for tool-less events)
  "notification_type": null,     // Notification discriminator (see below) — null unless last_event is Notification
  "events": [                    // rolling log (last 50), append-only
    { "ts": 1783124000, "event": "PostToolUse", "tool": "Bash" },
    { "ts": 1783124001, "event": "Stop",        "tool": null }
  ]
}
```

**Types:** every `*_ts` is an integer epoch. `windowid` is a **string**
(xdotool decimal or `0x…` hex; the app normalizes). `pid` is an integer.

### Focusing the right window — and the right tab

**Window** (`windowid`): captured at `UserPromptSubmit`/`SessionStart` (the
focused window then **is** the session's terminal) via `xdotool
getactivewindow`, preserved across events. Before using it, `focusSession()`
**validates** it against the session's process tree — a stale or recycled id
whose window no longer belongs to the session is discarded (so a click never
focuses the wrong window); the fallback is the first window owned by the
session's process.

**Tab** (invisible to X11 — only the terminal can select it):

| Terminal | Channel | Env var captured |
|---|---|---|
| Warp | `xdg-open warp://session/<uuid>` | `WARP_FOCUS_URL` |
| Tilix | `gdbus … org.gtk.Actions.Activate activate-terminal <id>` | `TILIX_ID` |

The decision logic (`pickWindow`/`tabChannel`) is a pure module,
[`src/focus.js`](src/focus.js) — `main.js` only does the I/O. On X11 the window
is raised, then the tab is selected; on Wayland the tab channel goes first
(wmctrl only sees XWayland).

### Event → state mapping (computeState, renderer)

| Adapter event | level | reason (sub-icon) |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | done 🟢 | ✓ (initial) |
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse` | processing 🟡 | 🛠 |
| `Stop` | done 🟢 (→ awaiting 🔴⏰ if idle > 5 min) | ✓ / ⏰ |
| `PermissionRequest` | awaiting 🔴 | 🔑 |
| `Notification` | depends on `notification_type`: `permission_prompt` / `idle_prompt` / `elicitation_dialog` → awaiting 🔴❓; `auth_success` / `elicitation_complete` / `elicitation_response` → done 🟢✓ | ❓ / ✓ |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | awaiting 🔴 | ⚠️ |

## Adding a new agent

Two steps — the app adapts to whatever you declare:

1. **Register it** in [`src/agents.js`](src/agents.js): one line with `label`
   (UI), `comm` (process names in `/proc/<pid>/comm`, for detecting live
   sessions that don't have a state file yet).
2. **Write an adapter**: anything that writes state files following the
   contract above. [`hooks/traffic-hook.sh`](hooks/traffic-hook.sh) is the
   reference implementation — and it already serves **two** agents: for
   Antigravity CLI it runs with `AI_TL_AGENT=antigravity` and uses the
   canonical event vocabulary directly, so the renderer never learns per-agent dialects.

For Node-based CLIs whose process `comm` is just `node` (Antigravity), the
`/proc` probe identifies sessions by the script basename in the process
argv — declared via the `argv` field in the registry.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

- **Overlay shows "no active sessions"** — did you run `npm run setup-hook`?
  Already-open sessions only appear after their next event (send any prompt).
- **Click doesn't focus / focuses the wrong window** — on Linux, check that `wmctrl` and `xdotool` are installed. On macOS, click-to-focus uses AppleScript (`osascript`) to focus the window. If it fails, ensure `AI Traffic Lights.app` (or your terminal if running from source) has **Accessibility** permissions granted in *System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility*.
- **Wayland** — the overlay itself runs fine (XWayland). Native-Wayland
  windows can't be focused by third parties, so click-to-focus relies on the
  terminal's focus URI (Warp today); the global shortcut may not fire while a
  native-Wayland app has focus. Workarounds: click the tray icon, or bind a
  GNOME custom shortcut to the app's launch command — **relaunching toggles
  the overlay** (single-instance).
- **Where is my data?** — `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ai-traffic-lights/`
  (state files, window position, aliases). Delete it freely; it regenerates.
- **Renderer debug** — `ATL_DEBUG=1 npm start` logs to `/tmp/atl-renderer.log`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Test the adapter standalone:

```bash
echo '{"session_id":"t","hook_event_name":"Stop","cwd":"/tmp"}' | bash hooks/traffic-hook.sh
cat "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/ai-traffic-lights/state/t.json" | jq .
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Antigravity CLI adapter (hooks) + idle detection via argv probe
- [x] OpenCode adapter (plugin: chat/tool/idle/permission events, model
  capture — see `adapters/opencode/`)
- [x] Codex adapter (same hooks schema as Claude; model from payload) — note:
  after `setup-hook`, run `/hooks` in the Codex CLI once to trust the hook
- [x] Packaging: AppImage + .deb (electron-builder) — see [Releases](https://github.com/aronpc/ai-traffic-lights/releases)
- [x] Test suite (`node:test`) + CI
- [x] Reliable click-to-focus: window-id validation + exact tab in Warp
  (`focus_url`) and Tilix (`TILIX_ID` via D-Bus)
- [ ] Tab focus for terminals without a native channel (GNOME Terminal,
  zellij/tmux)
- [ ] Full native-Wayland window focus (today: XWayland + Warp focus URI +
  relaunch-to-toggle)
- [x] Configurable idle threshold & shortcut (tray → Preferences — stored in
  `~/.local/share/ai-traffic-lights/settings.json`)
